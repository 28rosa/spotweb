== Installation requirements ==
Spotweb has been regulary tested on several different systems. Spotweb is mostly used on:

* Unix-based (Linux, FreeBSD) operating systems or small NAS systems like Synology and Qnap 
* Apache Webserver
* PHP v5.3 or higher (modules required: ctyle, curl, DOM, gettext, mbstring, xml, zip, zlib, gd, openssl)
* MySQL webserver.

Spotweb also supports PostgreSQL and SQLite where SQLite is the least supported and tested database engine.

Please run 'testinstall.php' from within your browser before attempting anything further with Spotweb and make sure
all items are checked 'OK'.
	
== Installation instructions ==
1. Make sure the required dependencies are met
2. Create a new, empty, spotweb database in MySQL/PostgreSQL and create a user with all rights to this database
3. Extract the sourcecode to a directory in your webroot
4. Edit or create an 'ownsettings.php' and paste in your database settings (copy the structure from settings.php)
   into this file.
5. Run 'upgrade-db.php' to create the database structure and default users
6. Run 'retrieve.php' from within an console and let it run for several hours
7. Now you can visit Spotweb and use it as you like.
8. Schedule to run retrieve.php on regular times to update your Spotweb database with new spots.

== Troubleshooting ==
When a white page appears instead of your Spotweb installation, this usually indicates an typing error in either
your ownsettings.php or a configuration error in your webserver.

Please consult your Apache's errorlog for the exact error and fix it.
